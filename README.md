**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Title**

Around the US

**Project Description**
This project is about making a interactive page where people can remove and add pictures. Also have to make it a responsive page, so if the user is a mobile phone or on a laptop, it will still look organized.

**Technology**

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Figma
4. Grid
5. Responsive design
6. Flexbox
7. Buttons
8. In this project, you will have to use figma to to create the webpage, which teaches us to be able to breakdown the page into parts.

**Images**

./images/demo/mobile.png
This an image on how the page looks like fro a mobile phone and notice how there is no horizontal scroll.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
